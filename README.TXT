This archive contains the sources for FDA v7.2. The BASIC source for the main
program is in BAS and the MS Word documents from which the FDA v7.1
documentation has been produced is in DOC. (Sorry, the one for APPENDIX.TXT has
been lost.)
The main program consists of 5 BASIC modules, of which 2 are needed only for
Pro, 1 only for Auto, and 2 for both. It builds with the current ASMEXT and
SWINDRV libraries. See BAS\FDAMAK72.* for the details. FDA v7.2 differs from
v7.1 in that the copyprotection code has been ripped out. For an idea of what
this code amounted to, look in BAS\OBSOLETE.
